# Milestone 5: Communicating Your Design

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

## Overview

You are to communicate your design and your design process.
You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
You will now develop a digital mockup of key elements of your design
and will share your design and the insights that led to it through a poster and a web post detailing your process.
