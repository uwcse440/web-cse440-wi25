# Assignment 3.3: Scenarios and Storyboards

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_4} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to choose a design direction to pursue in the remainder of this course.
You will select a design direction, choose two focus tasks as your emphasis,
and sketch task walkthroughs showing how your focus tasks are accomplished with your selected design.

First present your current design problem.
Your design problem may be the same as in Assignment 3.2,
but if your understanding or focus has changed, be sure to reflect that here.

Then present the three distinct designs you have proposed.
These may be the same as in Assignment 3.2,
but also may have evolved to have each have a more distinct direction or focus.

Next provide a summary of key feedback your group receives from design critique and your reflection on the feedback. 
Describe each key feedback in terms of suggestions and explain why or why not your group decides to adopt this feedback.

__Select a design__ to pursue in the remainder of this course.
This might be a design you presented in Assignment 3.2,
or it might be a new design you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.
Sketch key aspects of the design needed to illustrate its approach to your tasks.

__Select two focus__ tasks to pursue in the remainder of this course.
These might be tasks you presented in Assignment 3.2,
or they might be new tasks you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.

Prepare one paragraph describing your rationale for the selected design.
For example, address what makes your selected design more compelling to pursue than your other designs.
For each focus task, prepare another paragraph describing your rationale for the selected task.
For example, address what makes your selected tasks more compelling to pursue than your other tasks
or discuss why your two focus tasks will work well together in defining and exploring your design.
In your rationale, draw upon data from your design research and feedback from critiques.
Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which focus tasks you chose, and why you chose them.

For each focus task, __create a storyboard__
conveying context and detail around interaction with your design.
A storyboard should include one or more characters and settings,
should establish motivation and satisfaction,
and should provide insight into the design and the task.
Storyboards should not include unnecessary details or frames.
As needed, ensure clarity of your story through captions,
other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or other techniques.

For each focus task, also develop a step-by-step __task walkthrough__.
This should focus on the design itself, sketching each significant step in accomplishing the task.
This will typically be a sequence of images,
with each image annotated to indicate how a person moves forward in the walkthrough.
Your focus task provides the context for sketching this additional level of detail in your design,
and your task walkthroughs should aim to be sufficient as the starting point for developing a paper prototype.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_4} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slides deck with the following structure:

  Design & Task Selection
    - 1 slide: Current design problem.
    - 3 slides: Proposed designs.
    - 1 slide: Summary and Reflection of Feedback from Design Presentations
    - 1 slide: Selected design title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
    - 1 slide: Sketches illustrating the overall design approach.
    - 1 slide: Rationale for selected design.
    - 1 slide: Selected focus tasks and rationale for selected focus tasks.

  For each focus task (2 total):
    - 1 slide: Focus task title and storyboard.
    - Multiple slides: Sketches of a step-by-step task walkthrough with the selected design.

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).

## In Class

Be prepared use your focus task walkthroughs to begin developing a paper prototype of your design.

## Completion Grading

This assignment will be graded on completion of the following components:

1. __Current Design Problem__

   This may be taken directly from your Assignment 3.2,
   or it may be updated if your framing of the design problem has evolved in defining tasks and exploring designs.

2. __3 Proposed Designs__

   Each Design should consist of:
     - Title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
     - Sketches illustrating the overall design approach.

3. __Summary and Reflection of Feedback from Design Presentation__
   
   - Key feedback received from staff on your proposed designs. 
   - Reflection of feedback: what are the suggestions your group decides (not) to adopt? why?

4. __Selected Design Title & Summary__

   This might be a design you presented in Assignment 3.2,
   or it might be a new design you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.

5. __Selected Design Overview__

   Sketch key aspects of the design illustrating the overall design approach.

6. __Selected Design Rationale__

   Prepare one paragraph describing your rationale for the selected design.
   
7. __Focus Tasks & Rationale__

   Select two focus tasks to pursue in the remainder of this course.
   These might be tasks you presented in Assignment 3.2,
   or they might be new tasks you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.
    
   Prepare a paragraph for each focus task describing your rationale for the selected task.
   For example, address what makes your selected tasks more compelling to pursue than your other tasks.

8. __Focus Task Storyboards__

   For each focus task, create a storyboard
   conveying context and detail around interaction with your design.

   A storyboard should include one or more characters and settings,
   should establish motivation and satisfaction,
   and should provide insight into the design and the task.

   Storyboards should not include unnecessary details or frames.
   As needed, ensure clarity of your story through captions,
   other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or other techniques.

9. __Focus Task Walkthroughs__

   For each focus task, develop a step-by-step task walkthrough.
   This should focus on the design itself, sketching each significant step in accomplishing the task.
   
   Task walkthroughs should aim to be sufficient as the starting point for developing a paper prototype.
   
10. __Clarity and Presentation__
